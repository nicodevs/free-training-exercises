# v-model in action

In Vue 3, `v-model` is a directive that allows two-way data binding between a form input element and a Vue component's data. It utilizes Vue 3's reactivity system to automatically synchronize changes between the input element and the underlying data property, providing a convenient way to manage form input state in Vue components without the need for manual event handling and data synchronization.
