# Vue Reactivity

Vue 3 introduces a new reactivity system that enables automatic tracking and updating of data changes in a Vue application. It uses a proxy-based approach to detect changes to reactive data properties, allowing for fine-grained reactivity at the property level. This makes it easier to build dynamic and reactive user interfaces in Vue 3, with improved performance and flexibility compared to Vue 2's reactivity system.
